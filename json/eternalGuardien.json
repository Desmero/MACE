Your basic but potent strike allows you to harry and disrupt a foe until they lay down their arms. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 11 + your initiation modifier) or become cursed and unable to move within your threatened area (including with 5-foot steps and using the Withdraw action) without provoking an attack of opportunity from you for 24 hours. If the target drops all weapons it is holding, it can make another saving throw to end this effect. An affected target that is not holding a weapon can draw or pick up a weapon, then drop it to gain a new saving throw, but can never gain more than one save per round against this curse."
