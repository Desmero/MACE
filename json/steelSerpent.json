The disciple makes an attack against an opponent which if successful deals an additional 12d6 points of damage and bypasses all damage reduction the target may possess. The awesome force of the disciple’s ki is so strong that it has the potential to paralyze the opponent on a failed Will save (DC 18 + initiation modifier) for one round. Additionally, if the disciple is using poison or a prana maneuver with this strike, increase the saving throw DC by +4. This is a supernatural ability."

The weaving, hypnotic motions of that most venomous of serpents manifests in the lithe movements of the disciple, whose gaze paralyzes a foe with its intensity. The disciple gains a gaze attack with a range of 30- ft. (see gaze attacks in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 1 for more information on how to avoid gaze attacks). Creatures coming within this range are shaken by the disciple’s deadly presence and the glint of his eyes (Will save DC 18 + initiation modifier negates). When the disciple focuses his gaze (as an attack action) on a target, it may make a Will save (DC 18 + initiation modifier) to resist being paralyzed for 1d4 rounds by his hypnotic gaze. A successful save negates this effect. The disciple may only have one opponent paralyzed at a time. This is a mind-affecting, compulsion effect. This is a supernatural ability."

When a disciple initiates this maneuver and strikes a foe, he shows his deadly intent and knowledge in a display of terrible force, striking a foe’s heart chakra and sending a cascade of poisonous ki through its body to annihilate the lifeforce of the target. The disciple makes an attack against a foe which if successful the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 19 + initiation modifier). If this save fails, the target is instantly slain as its body’s energies revolt and consume it in a flash, reducing the body to ash (equipment is unharmed). If the target succeeds on this save, its body still suffers from the experience as the attack inflicts an additional 50 points of damage. If the target dies from this, its body also dissolves into ash. Victims slain by this attack cannot be resurrected normally; a wish or miracle spell must be cast first to restore the life-force of the victim’s spirit before any raise attempt can be attempted. This is a supernatural ability."
