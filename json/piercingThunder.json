In addition, your movement ignores difficult terrain and intervening creatures, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Rather than making an attack at the end of your charge, your strike targets every opponent who was caught in your path; treat your movement as a line-shaped effect for determining who is affected. Each opponent caught within the line takes damage as if you had hit them with an attack with a weapon you are wielding (including damage from magical properties or other bonuses), and must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 19 + your initiation modifier) or take an additional 15d6 points of damage. A successful save halves the additional damage, but does not negate the damage from your attack. Use the same damage roll for each creature. This strike can only be initiated with a discipline weapon."
