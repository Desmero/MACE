      "description": "A Golden Lion disciple shapes the very nature of war, and this technique allows him to direct his foes through his allies’ blades as easily as a knife through bread. With a mighty cry and a tremendously potent attack, the disciple ruins his foe. The initiator makes a melee attack inflicting an additional 12d6 points of damage, and forces the foe to move up to twice the target’s base speed in the direction of the initiator’s choosing in a straight line. If the target is incapable of movement, then the target simply takes the damage as normal. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to all those capable of making them against the target except for the initiator of this maneuver."
