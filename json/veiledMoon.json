Each attack gains a +2 competence bonus and inflicts an additional 4d4 points of force damage. Secondary attacks such as off-hand attacks and secondary natural attacks only add 2d4 of force damage.

Failure indicates that the target is shifted fully into the Astral plane, body and all, and the target may not return to the Material plane for one hour. If the foe has no way to return to the Material plane after this duration has expired, he is effectively stranded and must find his own way back to his world. If the target succeeds his saving throw, he is still shunted to the Astral plane, but returns automatically to the Material plane after one minute. While in the Astral plane, the target is tethered to his body at the location he occupied before being pushed into the Astral Plane with a silver cord as normal (per astral projection)."
