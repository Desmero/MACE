When you initiate this maneuver, you create a 50-foot line that deals 15d6 points of damage. Creatures caught in the line can make a Reflex save (DC 17 + your initiation modifier) to take half damage. Any creature that fails its Reflex save must also succeed at a Fortitude save with the same DC or become dazed for one round."
