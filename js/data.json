The initiator must make a melee attack against a target creature, and if successful, in addition to damage the target must make a Will save (DC 14 + initiation modifier) or be confused (as the spell confusion) for 1d4 rounds. After the application of this maneuver, the subject briefly forgets that the initiator exists and thus may not target the initiator while confused."
